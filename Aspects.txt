Since most systems incluse crosscutting concerns, it's no suprise that a few
techniques have emerged to modularize their implementation. Such techniques 
include mix-in classes, design patterns, and domain-specific solutions.

With mix-in classes you can differ a concerns final implementation. 
The primary class contains a mix-in class instance and allowes the systems 
other parts to set the instance.
In credit card example, the class implementing business logic composes a logger.
Another part of the system could set this logger to get the appropriate
logging type. The logger could be set to log using a filesystem or messaging
middleware. Although the nature of logging is now deffered, the composer
nevertheless contains the code to invoke logging operations at all log
points and controls the logging information.

Behavioral design patterns, like Visitior and Template Method, let you defer
implementation. However, just in case with mix-ins, the control of the 
operation -- invoking visiting logic or invoking template methods -- stays 
within the main classes.

Domain specific solutions, such as frameworks and application servers, let
developers address some crosscutting concerns in a modularized way. The
EJB architecute addresses crossuctting concernes such as security, administration
performance, and container-managed persistence. Bean developers focus on the business
logic, while the deployment developers focus on depleyment issues,such as gean-data
mapping to a database.

AOP lets you implement individual concerns in a loosly coupled fashion,
and combine these implementations to form the final system.
AOP differs most from OOP in the way it addresses crosscutting concerns. With
AOP, each concern's implementation remains unaware that other concerns are
"aspecting" it. Example, credit card processign module doesn't know that the other
concerns are logging or authenticating its operations.

At high level, an AOP language specifies two componenets:
        - Implementation of concerns, mapping of individual requirement into code
          so that compiler can translate it into executable code.
        - Weaving rules specification, how to compose independently implemented concerns
          to form the final system.

In addtion, AspectJ also allows the aspecting of other aspects and classes in several ways.
The each concern's implementation is oblivious to the fact that it is being aspected by other
concerns.
You can introduce new data members and new methods, as well as declare a class to implement
additional base classes and interfaces.

Join points - define specific points in a program's execution. Joinpoints could define calls to
specific methods in a class. Candidate joinpoints include calls to a method, a conditional check,
a loop's beginning, or an assignment. Joinpoints also have a context associated with them.
A method-call joinpoint could have the target object and its argument as part of the context.
Pontcut - is the language construct that specifies Join point or specify joinpoint collection.
It collects specific context atthose points, it let you expose context at the joinpoint to an
advice implementation.
Advice - defines pieces of an aspect implementation to be executed at pointcuts.
Aspect - combines these primitives.

>>>>>
Named pointcuts explicitly specify their names.You can reuse such pointcuts for defining other pointcuts,
defining part of an advice, overriding a pointcut ...
Annonymous pointcuts become defined at the point of their usage, in advice specification or as a part of
some other pointcut's definition, and cannot be reused.

>>>>>
Advice implementations often require access to data at the joinpoint. For example, to log certain operations,
an advice might need information, called context, about a method and arguments to it.
Pointcuts, therefore, allow exposure of the context at the execution point to pass to an advice implementation.
AspectJ offers target(), this(), and args() pointcuts to collect the context.

>>>>>
AspectJ supports a limited form of reflection.Each advice body has access to sa special object, thisJoinPoint,
which contains the information about the joinpoint.

>>>>>
Advices specify the executable code when reaching certain pointcuts. AspectJ provides three ways to associate an advice with a joinpoint:
before, after, and around a joinpoint's execution.
A before advice runs just before the joinpoint, whereas an after advice runs just after.
With an after advice, you can specify after normal return, after throwing an exception, or after returning either way from a joinpoint.
An around advice surrounds a joinpoint and has control if the joinpoint's execution should proceed. It can also decide to proceed with
a different argument set.

>>>>>
Aspect puts together pointcuts and advices.
Aspects resemble clasess: an aspect can contain methods and fields, extend other classes or aspects and implement
interfaces. Aspects differ from classes in that you cannot create an objext from an aspect using new().

AspectJ allows classes to declare pointcuts. You must declare "static" pointcuts declared inside a class.
However, AspectJ doesn't allow classes to contain advices; only aspects can contain advices.

An aspect can mark itself and any pointcut as abstract. Abstract pointcuts act similary to a class's abstract methods,
they let you defer the details to the derived aspects. A concrete aspct axtending an abstract aspect can then provide 
concrete definitions of abstract pointcuts

You can define aspect as inner class (or inner aspect) of the class, But aspec must be declared as 'static'

>>>>>
AspectJ lets you introduce methods or fields to classes and interfaces.
Interestingly, AspectJ lets you introduce method implementations and fields into interfaces.
You can, for example, provide a default implementation of a few methods in an interface.
aspect IntroduceMethodIllustration {
        private void MyClass.foo() { 
                System.out.println("This is foo");
        }
        private static int MyClass.instanceCount = 0;
}

With AspectJ, you can modify an existing class's inheritance hierarchy. Using these constructs, you can declare
super classes and interfaces of an existing class or interface.
aspect MakeMyClassSerializable {
        declare parents : MyClass implements Serializable;
}

AspectJ can soften a checked exception into an unchecked exception for a particular method set. Such methods then behave
as if they've thrown an unchecked exception of type org.aspectj.lang.SoftException, which wraps the original exception.
aspect SoftenDateFetcherRemoteException {
        declare soft : 
            RemoteException : (call(public * DateFetcher.*(..))
                               || call(public DateFetcherImpl.new(..)))
                              && within(Test);
}

Other AspectJ features:
        - You can declare one aspect as dominant over others to control precedence when multiple aspects
          affect a certain pointcut.
        - By default, Aspect J associates aspects with other classes and aspects, and therefore all aspectee
          instances share the aspect's state. Beyond the default association type, AspectJ offers additional
          types: perthis, pertarget, percflow, and percflowbelow. Each associates a separate aspect instance
          with a self object, target object, control flow, and control flow excluding the pointcut, respectively.
        - You can mark an aspect privileged, which gives it access to the private members of aspected classes.


>>>>
One best practice in AspectJ is to declare a special aspect whose task consists simply of declaring precedence for other aspects.
Actually it doesn't work with abstract aspects
public aspect MyAspectOrdering{
	declare precedence: EventListenerWeakening,EventListenerUniqueness;
}
